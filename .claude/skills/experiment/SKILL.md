# Experiment
Hypothesis-driven development workflow. Every experiment produces evidence.

## Invocation
`/experiment` — start a new experiment
`/experiment log` — show the experiment log
`/experiment <id>` — resume or review an existing experiment

## New Experiment Flow
1. **Ask** the user for:
   - **Hypothesis**: a falsifiable statement ("I believe X because Y")
   - **Falsification criterion**: what would prove it wrong ("If Z, the hypothesis fails")
   - **Method**: how to test it (code change, test run, benchmark, data probe, etc.)
   - If the user already stated the hypothesis inline, extract it — don't re-ask.

2. **Assign an ID**: `EXP-<NNN>` (next sequential number from `experiments/LOG.md`).

3. **Create the experiment file**: `experiments/EXP-<NNN>.md` using this template:
```markdown
# EXP-<NNN>: <short title>
**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Status:** running | confirmed | falsified | inconclusive
**Hypothesis:** <the falsifiable statement>
**Falsification criterion:** <what would disprove it>
**Method:** <how we test it>

## Setup
<code changes, config, branch — whatever is needed>

## Run
<commands executed, output captured>

## Evidence
<data, metrics, logs, diffs — the raw signal>

## Outcome
<confirmed | falsified | inconclusive>
<what we learned, in 1-3 sentences>
```

4. **Execute the method** — write code, run tests, benchmarks, or probes as needed.

5. **Record evidence** — capture output, metrics, diffs into the experiment file.

6. **Conclude** — update status and outcome. Append a one-liner to `experiments/LOG.md`.

## Rules
- Every experiment MUST have a falsification criterion before running.
- Record evidence even when the outcome is obvious — the log is the value.
- "Inconclusive" is a valid outcome. State why and what would resolve it.
- Don't delete or edit past outcomes. Corrections are new experiments.
- Keep experiment files self-contained.
- If an experiment changes code that should persist, commit it separately from the experiment file.
